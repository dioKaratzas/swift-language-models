# Mapping

How Foundation Models requests become OpenAI Responses requests, and how OpenAI's answers come back.

## Overview

Each request is a `POST` to `responses` with `stream` set to `true`. A setting the catalog lists per model, such as
`temperature`, `top_p`, `max_output_tokens`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `reasoning` or `parallel_tool_calls`, reaches the
model only when the model lists it in ``OpenAIModel/supportedParameters``; otherwise it's left out, so a model that
doesn't take it isn't sent it. A model that reasons takes `temperature` and `top_p` only while its effort is `none`,
so a request that sets another effort, or goes to a model that always reasons, leaves them out. A request that sets no
effort sends them to a model that can stop reasoning, as the official SDKs do, since the catalog's default effort
doesn't always match the model's own: GPT-5.4 mini takes them, although its catalog default is `medium`. The tables say
which settings go out whatever the model lists, such as `service_tier` and `text.verbosity`.

A setting left out is logged, and a debug build shows a runtime warning for it. The Responses API has no `top_k` and
no `seed`, so `.random(top:seed:)` and the seeds of sampling modes never reach OpenAI, as <doc:RepeatableRuns>
explains.

Data attachments need iOS, macOS, visionOS or watchOS 27.2 at run time, and Xcode 27.2 at build time, since earlier
SDKs lack them. Built with an earlier Xcode, the package takes no data attachments.

### Requests

| Foundation Models | OpenAI |
|---|---|
| Instructions | A `developer` message for a model that reasons, and a `system` message for one that doesn't |
| Prompt | A `user` message with `input_text` parts |
| One answer | Its `reasoning` items, an `assistant` message for each of its messages, with its text and `phase`, and a `function_call` item for each tool call, in the order they came |
| An answer's reasoning | The `reasoning` items it came as, with their encrypted reasoning, sent back only to the model that wrote them, or to the model it's a dated snapshot of. An answer with neither text nor tool calls sends no reasoning back |
| Tool output | A `function_call_output` item, matched to its call by `call_id` |
| Attachment label | An `input_text` part just before the attachment |
| Image attachment | An `input_image` part with a JPEG data URL: upright, on white, scaled down to at most 2,048 pixels on its longer side, without the image's metadata, and `detail` `auto`; an image at an http or https address goes as that address |
| Image data attachment, in any kind ImageIO reads | An `input_image` part, as for an image attachment |
| PDF data attachment | An `input_file` part with `filename`, the label with `.pdf` added when it doesn't end in `.pdf`, or `document.pdf` without a label, and `file_data`, a data URL |
| Plain-text data attachment | An `input_text` part |
| A tool output with attachments | The `function_call_output` item's `output` as parts |
| An image attachment when the model doesn't take images | `LanguageModelError.unsupportedCapability` with `.vision`, before any request, as Foundation Models throws |
| A data attachment the model doesn't take, such as audio or video; an attachment in the instructions | `LanguageModelError.unsupportedTranscriptContent`, before any request |
| An answer's attachments, generated data entries | Left out |
| Response schema | `text.format`: `json_schema` with `strict` set to `true`; a request is refused before it's sent, with `LanguageModelError.unsupportedCapability` and `.guidedGeneration`, unless the model lists `structured_outputs`, as Foundation Models checks the model's capabilities |
| Guides on a schema | The full schema; when OpenAI rejects one of its constraints, with a 400 whose message names a constraint keyword and says it isn't supported, permitted or allowed, the request goes once more with the portable schema, whose constraints move into the description |
| `includeSchemaInPrompt` | The schema also goes in the prompt that asked for it |
| Tools | `tools` entries of type `function`, with `strict` set to `false`, so OpenAI keeps each tool's schema as it is |
| `temperature` | `temperature`, clamped to 0–2: for a model that reasons, only with the effort `none`, or with no effort set when the model can stop reasoning |
| `samplingMode` `.greedy` | `temperature` 0 |
| `samplingMode` `.random(top:seed:)` | Nothing; `top_k` and `seed` are left out and logged |
| `samplingMode` `.random(probabilityThreshold:seed:)` | `top_p`, clamped to 0–1; `seed` is left out and logged |
| `maximumResponseTokens` | `max_output_tokens`, at least 16, the fewest OpenAI takes; a lower limit is raised and logged |
| `toolCallingMode` | `tool_choice`: `auto` or `required`, sent only with the session's tools. A session with tools on a model that doesn't take them throws `LanguageModelError.unsupportedCapability` with `.toolCalling` before any request, as Foundation Models checks the model's capabilities |
| `reasoningLevel` | `reasoning.effort`, moved to the nearest effort the model accepts, and logged when it moves; `.off` goes as `none` where the model takes it. Every request of a model that reasons also sends `include` with `reasoning.encrypted_content` |
| Request metadata | `metadata`, string values within OpenAI's limits; the keys past them are left out and logged |

### OpenAI settings

| Swift | OpenAI |
|---|---|
| ``OpenAIOptions/storage`` | `store`: left out with ``OpenAIOptions/Storage/automatic``, so OpenAI keeps the response; `true` with ``OpenAIOptions/Storage/stored``; `false` with ``OpenAIOptions/Storage/notStored``, and later turns then send back only the reasoning items that carry their reasoning encrypted |
| ``OpenAIOptions/reasoningSummary`` | `reasoning.summary`, for a model that reasons |
| ``OpenAIOptions/verbosity`` | `text.verbosity`, as set, to every model, as the official SDKs send it; models older than GPT-5, such as o3 and GPT-4.1, take only `medium` and reject any other value with a 400 |
| ``OpenAIOptions/serviceTier`` | `service_tier` |
| ``OpenAIOptions/parallelToolCalls`` | `parallel_tool_calls`, `true` or `false`, with the session's tools when the model lists it; left out with ``OpenAIOptions/ParallelToolCalls/automatic`` |
| ``OpenAIOptions/cacheKey`` | `prompt_cache_key`: the id of the session's first prompt for ``OpenAIOptions/CacheKey/session``, or the app's own key for ``OpenAIOptions/CacheKey/named(_:)`` |
| ``OpenAIOptions/endUserID`` | `safety_identifier` |
| ``OpenAIAuthentication/apiKey(organization:project:_:)`` | `Authorization: Bearer` header, with `OpenAI-Organization` and `OpenAI-Project` when they're set, to `https://api.openai.com/v1/` |
| ``OpenAIAuthentication/apiKey(baseURL:organization:project:_:)`` | The same headers, to `responses` under its base URL |
| ``OpenAIAuthentication/proxied(baseURL:headers:)`` | Its headers, to `responses` under its base URL, instead of `https://api.openai.com/v1/` |
| The package and the app | `User-Agent` header: `swift-language-models ({bundleID}/{appVersion}; Swift/{swiftVersion}; {os}/{osVersion})`, such as `swift-language-models (com.example.Planner/2.3; Swift/6.4; iOS/27.0.1)`; outside an app bundle, without the app |
| ``OpenAILanguageModel/idleTimeout`` | The request's `timeoutInterval` |

### Answers

| OpenAI | Foundation Models |
|---|---|
| `response.output_text.delta` | Response text, as it is, even text in `<think>` tags |
| `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta`, `response.reasoning_text.delta` | Reasoning text, in the order it arrives, with a blank line between the parts of a summary |
| `reasoning` items, as `response.output_item.done` carries them | The reasoning entry's signature, with every member OpenAI sent, and with the places of the messages and calls that came between them, so they go back on later turns in their order |
| A `message` item's `phase` | The `phase` and the text's length of each message, under ``OpenAIMetadataKey/phases`` |
| The messages of a guided answer | As the official SDKs parse them, only the first message with no phase or the `final_answer` phase is the answer that decodes. The others, such as `commentary`, stay out of the response text, and their text goes under ``OpenAIMetadataKey/phases`` with their phase, so they go back on later turns in their places |
| `function_call` items and `response.function_call_arguments.delta` | One tool-calls entry per answer, so parallel calls make one round; a call whose arguments arrive only in `response.output_item.done` gets them from there |
| `response.output_text.annotation.added` of type `url_citation` | `Citation` values on the response entry, under `LanguageModelMetadataKey.citations`, once each, with offsets that count from the start of the answer's text, or none when text that isn't ASCII comes before the cited message; they aren't sent back |
| `response.refusal.delta` | `LanguageModelError.refusal`, with the refusal's text |
| `usage` | Usage: `input_tokens`, `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, `output_tokens` and `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`; in its metadata, the prompt tokens written to the cache when OpenAI reports them |
| The response's `id`, `model` and `service_tier`, and the `x-request-id` header | Metadata of the entry that ends the answer, under the shared keys of `LanguageModelMetadataKey`; `model` also goes on the reasoning entry |
| `response.completed` | Finish reason `stop`, or `tool_calls` when the answer ends in tool calls |
| `response.incomplete` with `incomplete_details.reason` `max_output_tokens` | Finish reason `length`: an answer cut short at its token limit, which ends without an error; a guided answer cut short throws `GeneratedContent.ParsingError`, and one cut short inside its tool calls throws ``OpenAIError`` with ``OpenAIError/Code/invalidResponse`` instead, so no tool runs with partial arguments |
| `response.incomplete` with `incomplete_details.reason` `content_filter` | `LanguageModelError.guardrailViolation` |
| Another `incomplete_details.reason` | The reason as the finish reason, or `incomplete` when there's none |
| An `error` event, `response.failed` | The error its `error` object stands for, as the next table says |

### Metadata keys

| OpenAI | Key |
|---|---|
| `model` | `model`, on the entry that ends the answer and on its reasoning entry |
| `id` | `responseID` |
| `x-request-id` header | `requestID` |
| Why the answer ended | `finishReason` |
| `service_tier` | `serviceTier` |
| `url_citation` annotations | `citations`, on the response entry |
| `usage.input_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` | `cacheWriteTokenCount`, in the usage's metadata |
| Each message's `phase`, and the text of a guided answer's messages that don't decode | `openAI.phases`, on the entry that ends the answer |
| A failure's HTTP status, the code an ``OpenAIError`` would have, and the request id | `status`, `errorCode` and `requestID`, in the metadata of the `LanguageModelError` it becomes |

### Errors

| OpenAI | Thrown |
|---|---|
| `insufficient_quota`, `credit_balance_exhausted`, `organization_spend_limit_exceeded`, `project_spend_limit_exceeded`, `organization_usage_limit_exceeded` | ``OpenAIError`` with ``OpenAIError/isQuotaExhausted`` set, even as a 429 |
| `context_length_exceeded`, a 400 whose message mentions the context length or window | `LanguageModelError.contextSizeExceeded`, with the sizes the message names |
| 429, `rate_limit_exceeded` | `LanguageModelError.rateLimited`, with the reset date from `retry-after-ms` or `Retry-After`, or else the later of `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` and `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens` |
| `content_policy_violation`, `bio_policy`, `misalignment_policy_violation`, `image_content_policy_violation`, an `invalid_prompt` flagged for OpenAI's usage policies | `LanguageModelError.guardrailViolation` |
| `invalid_image`, `invalid_image_format`, `invalid_base64_image`, `invalid_image_url`, `image_too_large`, `image_too_small`, `image_parse_error`, `invalid_image_mode`, `image_file_too_large`, `unsupported_image_media_type`, `empty_image_file` | `LanguageModelError.unsupportedTranscriptContent`, naming the entries with images |
| 408, 504, `vector_store_timeout`, a timed-out connection | `LanguageModelError.timeout` |
| A connection that fails otherwise, such as without a network | Its `URLError`, unchanged |
| Anything else | ``OpenAIError``, with its status, message, code, error type, parameter, request id and retry delay |

An error's ``OpenAIError/code`` is OpenAI's `code`, or else its error `type`, such as `invalid_request_error`, which
``OpenAIError/errorType`` keeps whatever the code. Without
either, it's the kind the HTTP status stands for: ``OpenAIError/Code/authentication`` for a 401,
``OpenAIError/Code/permissionDenied`` for a 403, ``OpenAIError/Code/notFound`` for a 404,
``OpenAIError/Code/conflict`` for a 409, ``OpenAIError/Code/unprocessable`` for a 422 and ``OpenAIError/Code/server``
for a 500 or above. An error in the stream arrives after HTTP 200, so it has no status, and without a code it's
``OpenAIError/Code/server``.

A failed connection, a 408, 409 or 429, quota included, and any status from 500 up are retried up to twice, as the
official SDKs retry them, before any data arrives, and so is any status whose `x-should-retry` is `true`;
`x-should-retry: false` throws without a retry. A retry waits the `retry-after-ms` or `Retry-After` that OpenAI asks for
when that's more than zero and at most 2 minutes, and otherwise half a second, doubled for each retry before it up to 8
seconds, and cut by up to a quarter at random. A response that asks for more than 2 minutes throws at once, with the
wait on the error. A rate limit's reset date, and no other error's retry delay, falls back to the later of
`x-ratelimit-reset-requests` and `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`. A 400 that rejects a constraint of the response schema is
sent once more with the portable schema.
