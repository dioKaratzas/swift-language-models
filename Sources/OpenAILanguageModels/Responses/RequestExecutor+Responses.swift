    ///   - request: The transcript, tools, schema and options to send.
    ///   - model: The model to answer with.
    ///   - channel: Where the answer's events go.
    /// - Returns: The answer's response text, which the model's executor checks against the request's schema.
    /// - Throws: `LanguageModelError` for failures Foundation Models has a case for, `OpenAIError` for the rest, and
    ///   `CancellationError` when the task is cancelled. An error that the model's authentication throws passes through
    ///   as it is, unless it's a `URLError`, which maps as a failed connection's does.
