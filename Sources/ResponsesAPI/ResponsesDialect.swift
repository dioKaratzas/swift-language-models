/// How a provider speaks OpenAI's Responses format, which the format's executor sends requests in.
///
/// The executor owns the whole exchange: it builds the body from Foundation Models' request, authenticates and sends
/// it, retries a brief failure as the provider's connection allows and once with the portable schema when a host
/// rejects a constraint, streams the answer into Foundation Models' channel, sends each answer's `reasoning` items back
/// on later turns in the order they came, maps a failed connection and logs. A dialect adds only what its provider does
/// differently, through hooks that each get what that hook needs and nothing else:
///
/// - ``body(_:)``: the provider's own members, as ``BodyExtras``, and the few choices it makes about the format's.
/// - ``lists(_:)`` with ``listedMembers``: members sent only when the models take them.
/// - ``check(_:in:)``: the attachments its models take.
/// - ``instructionsRole``: the role the instructions go in.
/// - ``replays(_:)``: which of its reasoning entries go back.
/// - ``reasoningOrigin`` and ``phasesMetadataKey``: how its answers' reasoning and messages are tagged, so they go
///   back on later turns.
/// - ``streamState(_:)`` and ``facts(of:)``: what the response's headers carry beyond the format's, tracked across the
///   answer in ``StreamState``.
/// - ``error(for:)``: what each failure becomes.
///
/// Every hook has a default that adds nothing, except ``error(for:)``, which turns failures into the provider's own
/// public error, and ``body(_:)`` once the dialect sets ``BodyExtras``. Implement the hooks that have a default in the
/// extension that declares the conformance: only there does a misspelled one draw a warning instead of silently keeping
/// the default.
///
/// A request executor runs a dialect with
/// ``LanguageModels/DetailedLanguageModelRequestExecutor/respond(to:model:streamingInto:as:)``, the format's only way
/// in.
