/// How a provider speaks OpenAI's Chat Completions format, which the format's executor sends requests in.
///
/// The executor owns the whole exchange: it builds the body from Foundation Models' request, authenticates and sends
/// it, retries once when a gateway is briefly unavailable and once with the portable schema when a host rejects a
/// constraint, streams the answer into Foundation Models' channel, maps a failed connection and logs. A dialect adds
/// only what its provider does differently, through hooks that each get what that hook needs and nothing else:
///
/// - ``headers(_:)``: headers beyond the authentication's.
/// - ``body(_:)``: the provider's own members, as ``BodyExtras``, and the few choices it makes about the format's.
/// - ``lists(_:)`` with ``listedMembers``: members sent only when the models take them.
/// - ``check(_:in:)`` with ``extraMedia``: the attachments its models take.
/// - ``replays(_:)`` and ``replayMembers(_:)``: the reasoning it sends back, as ``ReplayMembers``.
/// - ``streamState(_:)``, ``observe(_:into:)`` and ``facts(of:)``: what its chunks carry beyond the format's, as
///   ``ChunkExtras``, tracked across the answer in ``StreamState``.
/// - ``error(for:)``: what each failure becomes.
///
/// Every hook has a default that adds nothing, except ``error(for:)``, which turns failures into the provider's own
/// public error. A hook whose types the dialect sets has no default: a dialect that sets ``ChunkExtras`` and doesn't
/// read them in ``observe(_:into:)`` doesn't compile. Implement the hooks that have a default in the extension that
/// declares the conformance: only there does a misspelled one draw a warning instead of silently keeping the default.
///
/// A request executor runs a dialect with
/// ``LanguageModels/DetailedLanguageModelRequestExecutor/respond(to:model:streamingInto:as:)``, the format's only way
/// in.
