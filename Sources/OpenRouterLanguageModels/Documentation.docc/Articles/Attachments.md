# Attachments and generated images

Send images, PDFs, audio, video and text with a prompt, and get images back.

## Overview

Prompts and tool outputs carry images, and from iOS 27.2 and macOS 27.2 data attachments too: PDFs, audio, video and
text. A label goes before its attachment as text, so the model can name it, as an `ImageReference` does:

@Snippet(path: "swift-language-models/Snippets/Attachments", slice: "image")

An image goes as a JPEG, drawn upright from its orientation, on white, and scaled down so that its longer side is at
most 2,048 pixels. Only its pixels leave the device, never metadata such as where a photo was taken. An image at a web
address goes as that address.

### Attach files

Data attachments need Xcode 27.2 at build time, since earlier SDKs lack them. `FileAttachment`, from the
`LanguageModels` module, reads a file and tells its type from its extension, or wraps bytes of a type you name:

@Snippet(path: "swift-language-models/Snippets/Attachments", slice: "file")

- An image file, such as a PNG or HEIC file, goes as an image attachment does.
- A PDF goes as a file. A model that reads PDFs gets it as it is; for any other model OpenRouter reads it first, unless
  ``OpenRouterOptions/pdfEngine`` is ``OpenRouterPDFEngine/native``.
- Audio in WAV, MP3, AIFF, AAC, FLAC, Ogg or MPEG-4 goes with its format, video in MPEG-4, MPEG, QuickTime or WebM goes
  as data, and plain text goes as text.

`supportsDataAttachmentType(_:)` says whether the model and each of its fallbacks take a kind of data. When one of
them doesn't take an attachment, a request throws before sending anything, as Foundation Models does:
`LanguageModelError.unsupportedCapability` with `.vision` for an image attachment, and
`LanguageModelError.unsupportedTranscriptContent` for a data attachment, an image file included. Instructions become a
`system` message, which takes only text, so an attachment there throws `unsupportedTranscriptContent` too.

### Get images back

A model that generates images, such as `.googleGemini2_5FlashImage`, is asked for images and text when every model of
the request generates images and the request has no response schema. Each image it generates becomes a data entry of
its own, of the kind its data names, such as PNG:

@Snippet(path: "swift-language-models/Snippets/Attachments", slice: "images")

Generated images stay in the transcript but aren't sent back; to build on one, attach it to a later prompt. Data
entries need iOS 27.2 and macOS 27.2, and Xcode 27.2 at build time; without them, images aren't asked for.

Each request sends the whole transcript, so an attachment goes again with every later request of the session;
<doc:ChoosingAModel#What-a-request-costs> says what that costs.
