    ///   - request: The transcript, tools, schema and options to send.

    /// - Throws: `LanguageModelError` for failures Foundation Models has a case for, `OpenRouterError` for the
    ///   rest, and `CancellationError` when the task is cancelled. An error that the model's authentication
    ///   throws passes through as it is, unless it's a `URLError`, which maps as a failed connection's does.
