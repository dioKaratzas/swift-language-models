    /// Sends a format's request with the authentication's headers and the provider's, and opens its stream of

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - body: The request's body.
    ///   - portableSchemaBody: The body with its response schema in portable form, or `nil` when there's none to try.
    ///   - headers: The provider's headers, which take precedence over the authentication's.
    ///   - url: Returns where the request goes, or throws the provider's error when there's no valid URL.
    ///   - log: The request's log.
    /// - Returns: The stream, and the headers of its response.
    /// - Throws: ``ProviderHTTP/Failure`` for a response whose status isn't a success, after the retries, which the
    ///   format turns into the dialect's error; what the authentication and `url` throw; and a failed connection's
    ///   error.
