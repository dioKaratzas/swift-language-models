/// Shows a purple runtime warning in Xcode, in a debug build, for a likely mistake in the app that the package worked
/// around, such as a setting the model doesn't take.
///
/// Apple has no API for runtime warnings, so this does what Point-Free's IssueReporting does: it logs a fault to the
/// `com.apple.runtime-issues` subsystem, which Xcode shows as a runtime issue when the fault seems to come from one of
/// Apple's frameworks. The fault names SwiftUI's image when the process has loaded SwiftUI, and the caller's otherwise.
///
/// A release build shows nothing, and neither does a debug build whose app set ``LanguageModelsLogging/level`` to
/// ``LanguageModelsLogging/Level/off``; any other level leaves the warnings on.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - message: What the app likely got wrong, and what the package did instead.
///   - fileID: The caller's file, whose module names the warning's category.
///   - dso: The caller's image, which the fault names when SwiftUI isn't loaded.
