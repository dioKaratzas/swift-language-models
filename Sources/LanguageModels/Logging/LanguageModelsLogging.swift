/// How much the package writes to the unified logging system.

/// The package logs what each request sends, what it leaves out or changes from what the app asked for, retries,
/// which model and host answered, failures, and how long each request took. Every message has the subsystem
/// `com.niosoft.swift-language-models` and a category named after each provider module, or `LanguageModels` for what
/// the core logs, such as a request that may reach a model its provider stopped listing.
///
/// It never logs API keys, prompts, answers, tool arguments or outputs, or attachments, nor a host's error message,
/// which may quote the request. This covers the package's own logging: a recording with Instruments' Foundation Models
/// template can include prompts and responses, which Foundation Models records. Model ids, host names, parameter
/// names, HTTP statuses, error codes and timings are public.
///
/// Logging is on at every level, and the system decides what it keeps, as it does for Apple's frameworks: debug
/// messages only while a tool such as Xcode or Console shows them, info messages only in memory, and errors on disk.
/// Set a level once, early, to log less:
///
/// ```swift
/// LanguageModelsLogging.minimumLevel = .error  // Only failed requests and removed models.
/// LanguageModelsLogging.minimumLevel = .fault  // Nothing, since the package logs no faults.
/// ```
