/// A provider's configuration holds one, such as `OpenAIConfiguration`'s `retries`, and the provider decides which
/// failures are worth retrying, such as a failed connection or a server error. A request is never retried once its
/// answer starts arriving, or after it's cancelled:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Fail fast on an interactive screen.
/// model.configuration.retries = RequestRetries(limit: 1, longestServerWait: .seconds(5))
///
/// // Retry nothing, such as in a test or an evaluation that retries on its own.
/// model.configuration.retries = .disabled
/// ```

/// Without a wait the server asks for, a retry waits ``initialDelay``, doubled for each retry before it up to 16 times
/// ``initialDelay``, and cut by up to a quarter at random, so many clients that failed together don't retry together.
