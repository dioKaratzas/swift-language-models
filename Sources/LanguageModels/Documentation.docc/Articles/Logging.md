# Logging

See what each request sends, leaves out and returns, and choose how much the package logs.

## Overview

The package logs each request to the unified logging system, under the subsystem
`com.niosoft.swift-language-models`, with a category for each provider module, such as `OpenRouter`, and
`LanguageModels` for what the core logs. Each message
names its request by the first eight characters of the request's id, so the messages of requests sent at once can be
told apart.

| Level | Messages |
|---|---|
| Debug | What a request sends: the model, its fallbacks and the names of the options. Which model and host answered, the finish reason, whether the response cache served the answer, the time to the first token and the whole time. A cancelled request. A model-info call's path, status and time, and whether the one-minute cache answered it |
| Info | What a request leaves out or changes from what the app asked for: options the models don't list, metadata that isn't a string or is past the service's limits, a reasoning level sent as another effort, and a response cache's time to live outside its range. A retry after a gateway failure, or with a portable schema after a host rejected a constraint |
| Error | A request that may reach a model its provider stopped listing, as its model or a fallback, in the `LanguageModels` category. A failed request or model-info call: the error it became, such as `LanguageModelError.rateLimited`, with the HTTP status, error code and host it came from |

The package logs at these three levels only, so ``LanguageModelsLogging/Level/notice`` logs what
``LanguageModelsLogging/Level/error`` does, and ``LanguageModelsLogging/Level/fault`` logs nothing, although it
leaves the runtime warnings on.

The system decides what it keeps, as it does for Apple's frameworks: debug messages only while a tool such as Xcode
or Console shows them, info messages in memory, and errors on disk, up to a limit. Messages are formatted only when
someone reads them, so logging costs little.

### What stays out of the log

The package never logs API keys, prompts, answers, tool arguments or outputs, or attachments. Model ids, host names,
parameter names, HTTP statuses, error codes and timings are public. A host's error message, which may quote the
request, and the keys of metadata left out are private, so the system redacts them.

This covers the package's own logging. A recording with Instruments' Foundation Models template can include prompts
and responses, which Foundation Models records.

### Watch the messages

Filter Xcode's console by `subsystem:com.niosoft.swift-language-models`, or stream the messages in Terminal; for a
simulator, run the same command after `xcrun simctl spawn booted`:

```sh
log stream --level debug --predicate 'subsystem == "com.niosoft.swift-language-models"'
```

### Log less

Logging is on at every level. To log less, set ``LanguageModelsLogging/level`` once, early, from any thread:

```swift
import OpenRouterLanguageModels  // Or any provider module, each of which re-exports this one.

LanguageModelsLogging.level = .error  // Only failed requests and removed models.
LanguageModelsLogging.level = .off  // Nothing.
```

### Runtime warnings

In a debug build, Xcode also shows a purple runtime warning for a likely mistake: a request that may reach a model its
provider stopped listing, a request that leaves out or changes something the app asked for, and a response cache's
time to live outside its range. Setting the level to `.off` silences the warnings too; any other level leaves them on.
A release build never shows them.
